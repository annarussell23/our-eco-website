  <p1 class="blog"> 🌱🌏PLASTIC FREE MARCH = DONEZO !! 🌎🌸 (Long post disclaimer)
  <br>Thought I would test how easy it would be to live without buying any plastic for a month to sensitise myself to how much I usually use... and it was SO not impossible !!
  Other people should defs do this so sharing a few hints n tips for the followers out there so, read on if YOU TOO love the planet ✌🏼💚
  <br>
  <br>🥦 Food wise 🥖:
  <br>First things first, if you’re addicted to sweets (like myself) you’re gonna have to be okay with changing your lifestyle...😞
  For fresh stuff, supermarkets are basically a no go. For fruit and veg some supermarkets have a few things loose but otherwise just find your local greengrocers and you’re set! But in general, salad stuff like lettuce is V difficult to find not in plastic so just gotta accept a life without salad *sigh*
  Also dairy is particularly difficult, I ended up buying cartoned long life milk (ew) but the cheap tesco one actually tastes decent, plus lasts so win win. You will have to say goodbye to yoghurt and cheese though, unless you go to a fromagerie/deli or make it yourself… 🧀❌
  Otherwise bread, tinned stuff, sugar etc is easy but pulses/pasta/spices i fortunately have a nearby shop where you can fill it up in your own containers, as well as toiletries and cleaning products, so might be a bit trickier if you don’t have one of these (should be at least one in most big uni cities tho) shoutout to The New Leaf Co-op
  (Also FYI this is WAY easier to do if you don’t eat meat but if you do - frozen section in cardboard boxes, otherwise you’d just have to spend more to shop in a butcher/fishmongers. ooh also blue dragon brand does tofu in cardboard !)
  Also last minute food shopping is very tricky, so you just have to make sure you have a few staples around
  <br>
  <br>🛀🏻 Toiletries:
  <br>LUSH has shampoo/ conditioner/ moisturiser bars (or organic stores you can fill up your own containers).
  The inescapable reality of investing in a mooncup 😱 it’s bloody annoying 😏but basically a must to reduce all the plastic of ordinary sanitary products
  Cleaning products (refills on organic stores), toilet paper is V tricky, I found I had to give in on this one unless you can convince your flatmates to invest in companies like Who Gives A Crap
  Toothpaste - lush does chewable toothpaste tablets but my previous toothpaste lasted the whole month so not quite there yet
  <br>
  <br>
  Quite a long post but even if you just cut out plastic from one part of your life like veggies, you can see a huge difference and once you stop using it it actually becomes hideous to see how much we use absent-mindedly!
  #onceyouditchthewrapyounevergoback (genuinely it does make it morally very difficult to buy plastic after, especially after you’ve found all the alternatives anyway, so super effective way to curb your plastic habit forever)
  Plastic cheat total of the month:
  <br>* 1x plastic bag of rice (last minute panic)
  <br>* 1x toilet roll bag
  <br>* 1x straw that i was given
  <br>* 1x plastic window on cardboard box from takeaway food (v annoying)
